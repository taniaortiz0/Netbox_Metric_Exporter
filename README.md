## Setup

### PyCharm

To start off, I utilized PyCharm as my desired IDE for this project and will be setting up a few packages to have this playground looking user-friendly and ready to use.

### Ubuntu WSL

I decided to have my terminal to be utilizing Ubuntu and I am working alongside with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

### GitLab

I created a GitLab account to have that DevOps environment and also being able to practice my CI/CD pipelines. I then needed this integrated with Pycharm so I can make commits and push them to the merge request.



### Installation 

### Oh My Zsh

I wanted my terminal to look great using Oh My Zsh. 

First, I installed it:

<pre>sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"</pre>

Then, I wanted a theme so, I decided to go with agnoster however, you need to install a Powerline-patched font in order to work properly:

If you are running a Debian or Ubuntu-based Linux distribution:

<pre>sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline</pre>

Now, I can change the theme to Agnoster

<pre>nano ~/.zshrc</pre>

Find this line:

<pre>ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"</pre>

Change it to:

<pre>ZSH_THEME="agnoster"</pre>

Then, save (CTRL + O, Enter) and exit (CTRL + X).

Reloading the shell:

<pre>source ~/.zshrc</pre>

### UV

I installed UV, a fast Python package and project manager written in Rust. This package manager works like the speed of lighting and is useful to get the packages needed for this DevOps project.

To install UV:


<pre>curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh</pre>

Projects

<pre>uv init projectname</pre>
<pre>cd projectname</pre>
<pre>uv add ruff</pre>
<pre>uv run ruff check</pre>
<pre>uv lock</pre>
<pre>uv sync</pre>
<pre>uv tool install ruff</pre>
<pre>ruff --version</pre>

Python Install

<pre>uv python install</pre>

Creating a virtual environment:

<pre>uv venv</pre>

Install the locked requirements:

<pre>uv pip sync docs/requirements.txt</pre>
